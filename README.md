# craftos.d.ts

Contains work-in-progress TypeScript type definitions for the
[CraftOS-PC](https://www.craftos-pc.cc/) APIs, designed for use with
[TypeScriptToLua](https://typescripttolua.github.io/).

Currently supports:

- (Hopefully) all vanilla CraftOS APIs (from their wiki)
- (Hopefully) all modded CraftOS-PC APIs (from their
  [API reference](https://www.craftos-pc.cc/docs/api-reference))

Does NOT support:

- CC:Tweaked content (planned)
- Full documentation, most functions only have a single sentence of
  explanation. Even though for some functions this is okay, some should
  really be explained more. However, I've tried to include all
  *necessary* information in each doc, so you should be okay hopefully
